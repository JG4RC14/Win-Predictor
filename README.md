# ‚öΩ Soccer Match Prediction Model ‚Äì DTS 360 Project

This project was originally developed for my **DTS 360: Predictive Modeling** course. It demonstrates a full data science workflow using real-world soccer data from [FBref.com](https://fbref.com). The project includes data scraping, cleaning, training a predictive model, evaluating its performance, and saving the model for reuse.

## üîç Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to predict soccer match outcomes or related metrics (such as goal differentials) based on statistical data. The process begins with live web scraping from FBref, followed by data cleaning and feature engineering in `pandas`, model training using `scikit-learn`, and performance evaluation.

## üß† Skills Demonstrated

- **Web Scraping**: Collecting structured sports data from live websites with `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`
- **Data Cleaning & Processing**: Preparing raw HTML tables for modeling with `pandas`
- **Machine Learning**: Using pipelines, `LinearRegression`, and `GridSearchCV` for predictive modeling
- **Model Evaluation**: RMSE, R¬≤, and cross-validation techniques
- **Model Persistence**: Saving models with `joblib` for future use
- **Python Development**: Writing modular, readable, and well-structured code
